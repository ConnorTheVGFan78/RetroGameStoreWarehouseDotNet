                <p>Welcome to RetroGameStoreWarehouse.net!! This is a website that focuses on retro gaming stuff, including reviews, videos, news, and more. Despite the name, we do not sell games. We do not own a warehouse filled with games. You will find retro gaming stuff o’ plenty, but we aren’t going to sell you anything.</p>
                <p>Why the name? Well, back when a <i>certain</i> actual game store was getting criticized for bad business practices, several parodies appeared to poke fun at their store. The original concept for RGSW was to be one of those parodies, but a waning lack of interest in both the <i>certain</i> game store and people making fun of the <i>certain</i> game store caused original plans to be abandoned.</p>
                <p>So what do we do now? We already bought the domain name, what’s next? The answer: make a site about retro gaming, rather than making fun of the companies that sell used retro games at high prices with questionable quality.</p>
                <p>So, with all that out of the way, welcome to RGSW!! We hope you enjoy your stay!!</p>
